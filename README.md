# Object-Oriented Software Metrics Project

## Overview

This project involves the creation of a research paper on metrics for object-oriented software. The project includes the development of software tools and a console application to measure and analyze various object-oriented metrics. Our research aims to provide insights into the quality and maintainability of object-oriented codebases.

## Features

- Analysis of object-oriented metrics such as Coupling, Cohesion, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.
- Console application for running metric analyses on different code-bases.
- Detailed reports and visualizations of metric results.
- Integration with our website for additional resources and documentation.

## Installation

To install and run the software locally, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:

-      https://github.com/edaywalid/ObjectOrientedSoftwareMetrics
-      cd ObjectOrientedSoftwareMetrics
- Install the required dependencies:
- java >= 17
- maven >= 3.8.7
- make >= 4.4.1
- Run the console application:

          cd ObjectOrientedSoftwareMetrics/CONSOLE_METRIC_ANALYSER
          make run

## Usage

The console application can be used to analyze metrics for your object-oriented projects. To get started, follow these steps:

1.  Ensure your project code is accessible.
2.  Run the console application and follow the prompts to select the codebase and metrics you wish to analyze.
3.  View the generated report and visualizations for insights into your codebase.
